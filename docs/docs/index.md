# Potionx

### A Toolkit for rapidly building and deploying full-stack applications with Elixir and Vue

Potionx is a set of generators and modules that speeds up the process of setting up and deploying a full-stack application that uses Elixir with GraphQL for the server-side component and Vue for the frontend component.

> **Warning:** Still in early stages of development. Not suitable for production use.
