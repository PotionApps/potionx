  # ## Using releases
  #
  # If you are doing OTP releases, you need to instruct Phoenix
  # to start each relevant endpoint:
  #
  #     config :<%= @web_app_name %>, <%= @endpoint_module %>, server: true
  #
  # Then you can assemble a release by calling `mix release`.
  # See `mix help release` for more information.
